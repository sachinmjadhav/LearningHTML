    <!-- HTML 5 Semantic  Elements -->

    <!-- Semantics is the study of meaning of words and phrases in language.
    Semantic elements are the elements with meaning.
    A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both browser and the developer.
    Examples of non Semantic elements are <div>, <span> - tells nothing about its content.
    Examples of Semantic elements: <form>, <table>, <img> clearly defines its content. -->


    	<!-- Before HTML5 all websites gave their own names for navigation, sidebar, main content, header, footer. With this nature Search Engine Algorithm finds it difficult to find out different sections of the webpage. To resolve this, HTML5 Semantic elements are introduced. For HTML Semantic elements there is no special presentation on the webpage, but for any website development different parts of the webpage usage of Semantic Elements is recommended. -->
